/**
 * <p>An insert-only hash map that also supports range slicing (as defined by normal signed integer comparison).
 * The only condition is that for two keys k1, k2: k1 < k2 => k1.hashCode() <= k2.hashCode()
 * <p>
 * This data structure only yields acceptable performance for keys that are first sorted by some hash value (and may
 * then be sorted within those hashes arbitrarily), where a 32-bit (signed) prefix of the hash we sort by is returned by hashCode()
 *
 * <p>This is essentially a variant of a shalev/shavit "split ordered list" hashmap, except for simplicity we treat the hash
 * table as only an index into our hash-ordered linked-list, and we update the index lazily on reads/writes. We also use
 * a somewhat different explanation here for behaviour, which is perhaps easier to comprehend.
 *
 * <p>We are composed of two structures:
 * 1) a simple linked-list, in sorted order
 * 2) an index that permits quick lookups inside the linked-list
 * <p>
 * The index structure can be viewed in two ways: like a skip list overlay, or a hash table.
 * <p>
 * As a skip list, it has a height of lg(N) for N elements in the map; each level occurs in the range [2^(L-1)..2^L), i.e.
 * Level 0 : [0..1)
 * ...
 * Level 4 : [8..16)
 * ...
 * Level 6 : [64..128)
 * <p>
 * Each level splits the hash range into equal intervals, with each index having a "target" hash.
 * Any query for a hash >= this target is guaranteed to find a node strictly less than the target at this index,
 * with the expectation that it is the node *directly* preceding. So with a given level it is possible to find
 * an exact position desired in the linked-list by linear scan from this index position, having to scan no further
 * than the next index in the level.
 * <p>
 * For each index i in [0..2^(L-1)) for level L, if we have a total hash range of [0..H), target(i) = (i + 0.5) * H/2^(L-1)
 * <p>
 * To illustrate, for simplicity let's assume our hash space is [0..1024) (in fact it is [-2^31..2^31)).
 * <p>
 * Level 0 : [0                                            ]
 * Level 1 : [                     512                     ]
 * Level 2 : [         256                     768         ]
 * Level 3 : [   128         384         640         896   ]
 * Level 4 : [ 64   192   320   448   576   704   832   960]
 * <p>
 * We can see that each level is twice as large as the prior level, and effectively transforms our linked-list
 * into a skip-list for that level, only one where membership of the level is fluid based on a node's adjacency to the
 * target hash, instead of defined probabilistically at insertion time. One property worth highlighting here is that
 * once a level is created, its definition is _static_. Whilst the node indexed at any point in time may change, its
 * definition never does and so the same array index can be used to represent the lookup indefinitely. As such we
 * partition the index array so that we can append new levels without modifying prior levels.
 * <p>
 * Hashing:
 * We can also see that, if we flatten all of the levels into one address space, each level we add targets a location
 * exactly midway between all of the existing target locations. So if we have a good hash function, and N items
 * with lg(N) levels, any list portion between two target points in this flattened space will be of size 1, on average.
 * <p>
 * So to make this a hash table, all we need is to be able to locate which index we should be looking up in O(1) time.
 * The trick here is bitwise integer representations. In modern hash tables, the address space is a power of 2,
 * and a hash code is distributed across the table modulo this power of 2. This means that, when expanding (doubling)
 * the table, we are in effect introducing one new bit to the equation. Half of our items, on average, will have this
 * bit set, and half will not.
 * <p>
 * If we recall that each new level of the skip-list indexes into the mid-point of the existing map, we can see
 * a correspondence to this extra bit and the bitwise integer representation: if we expand into *lower* bits with each
 * growth, our extra bit by definition is the midpoint of any existing intervals. The extra bit represents a value of
 * half the existing interval between targets.
 * <p>
 * For illustrating this, let's narrow our hash range to [0..16), so that our skip-list looks like:
 * <p>
 * Level 0 : [0                           ]
 * Level 1 : [              8             ]
 * Level 2 : [       4            12      ]
 * Level 3 : [   2      6     10      14  ]
 * Level 4 : [ 1   3  5   7  9  11  13  15]
 * <p>
 * Now, let's translate these into their bitwise representations:
 * <p>
 * Level 0 : [0000                                                            ]
 * Level 1 : [                                1000                            ]
 * Level 2 : [                0100                            1100            ]
 * Level 3 : [        0010            0110            1010            1110    ]
 * Level 4 : [    0001    0011    0101    0111    1001    1011    1101    1111]
 * <p>
 * We can see this behaves exactly as expected from the above description: each level takes every number present in
 * any of the above levels, in order, but with the next lower bit set. i.e., with H levels present we will have all
 * numbers prefixed by the integers in the range [0..2^H) represented as the most-significant H bits.
 * <p>
 * The optimal index to use will occur in the last level if and only if the H'th highest bit is set, because this means
 * it occurs on-or-after one of the midpoints introduced by this level. So if it is not set we can eliminate this level,
 * and look at the prior level. We can apply the exact same logic iteratively, eliminating each level until we find
 * the desired one.
 * <p>
 * How does this help us?
 * <p>
 * We can apply this recursive logic in exactly one step: by truncating the integer we want to look up to its
 * first H bits, and then reversing them.
 * <p>
 * Recall that each level occurs in the range [2^(L-1)..2^L), i.e. the i'th index in the level can be located in the
 * global array as 2^(L-1)+i. i.e. by the integer i, but with the L'th lowest bit set. So by reversing our bits
 * if this is the level containing our optimal index, we would select it (the H'th highest bit would now be our L'th lowest)
 * This logic applies to all levels at once, simultaneously, by simple virtue of being an integer lookup (the missing bits
 * immediately truncate us to the correct level). This also applies _within_ a level by the same logic; since each
 * level is a repeat of the flattened representation of all parent levels only with a suffix bit, it can be seen to
 * itself be made up of a repeat of the same skip-list like structure internally in which the same logic applies.
 * <p>
 * So by reversing our bits, the resulting integer immediately indexes into the correct location in our table, and
 * we have a hash-indexed skip-list overlay structure.
 * <p>
 * One remaining complexity papered over in this description is that, to support signed value comparison we partition
 * the index into two parallel indexes, with all even indexes covering positive hashes, and all odd covering negative ones.
